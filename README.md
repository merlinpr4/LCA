# LCA
Lowest Common Ancestor in Java and Python done in two different IDE (Eclipse and PyCharm).

- *Familiar language :* Java
- *New language :* Python 

Implementation involves creating two arrays which traverse the tree and than comparison of both arrays to find last common element before it changes to find LCA.

Unit testing done with Junit testing for Java implementation. (JUnit 4 test ).
Unit testing done with unittest for Python implementation.

## How to Run:

### Eclipse Java:
1. Create a new project in eclipse. 
2. Create a new class LCA and use my LCA java implementation code.
3. Create a Junit Test case (https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/junit-tests-examples/) follow this link if help is needed and try my LCAtest cases.
4. Run the LCATest file to see the tests run.
1. Run coverage as Junit test to see 100% code coverage.

### PyCharm Python (a free Jetbrains license is available for students):
1. Create a new project in pycharm named LCA.
1. Implement my LCA python code in LCA.py file.
1. Left click on find_LCA select go to then Test and let Pycharm autogenerate the test using unitest then use my test_LCA code .
1. Implement my LCA unittest and run to see tests work
1. Click run python tests in test_LCA.py with Coverage to see 100 % code coverage. 

Note:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/ was used to help write LCA code implementations.
