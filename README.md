# LCA
Lowest Common Ancestor in Java and C++ for a binary tree done in two different IDE (Eclipse and PyCharm).
Familiar language : Java
New language : Python
Implementation involves creating two arrays which traverse the tree and than comparison of both arrays to find last common element before it changes to find LCA.
Unit testing done with Junit testing for Java implementation. (JUnit 4 test ).
Unit testing done with unittest for Python implementation.

How to Run:

Eclipse Java
Create a new project in eclipse 
Create a new class LCA and use my LCA java implementation src file
Create a Junit Test case (https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/junit-tests-examples/) follow this link if help is needed and try my LCAtest cases.
Run the LCATest file to see the tests run.
Run coverage as Junit test to see 100% code coverage
